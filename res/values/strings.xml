    <string name="intro_text">Use your bluetooth device to select which app you want to use to play music! &lt;p&gt;Simply hit &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;previous&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;play&lt;/i&gt; on your bluetooth device. Media router will pop up and ask you what application you want to handle the action. You can select using your phone &lt;b&gt;OR&lt;/b&gt; or you can navigate through the list using the &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;previous&lt;/i&gt; buttons on your bluetooth device. Android Media Router will speak what is currently selected. When you find the app you want, simply hit &lt;i&gt;play&lt;/i&gt; to foward the action to that application. &lt;p&gt;If music is already playing, Media Button Router stays out of the way, and lets whatever app is playing music handle pauses, previous, and next. &lt;p&gt; You &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; enable whatever handle headset preference your music apps have.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; There will be some apps that this will just not work well with.  Try finding replacements if you want to use this application. &lt;p&gt;If you are a developer, please feel free to contribute :)</string>
